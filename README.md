# District Development Portal
This is a project initiated for the purpose of participating in smart india hackathon 2k18.

We're going to breakdown the whole project into 3 main modules. I.e., creation portal, approval portal and the viewing portal.
This whole project was made in the idea of :
	1.  Any citizen/local department who is facing the public issues or having an idea of developing the citizenship can submit their subject to the district collector.
	2. Then the district collector/sub district collector can review the submitted project and can approve the legal ones.
	3. After the successf1ul approval of projects, the projects are now viewed publicly to the students in all institutions. Where the students can view and take the projects to solve them.


Creation Portal :

	This is the area where the citizen can submit his/her idea or problem to the district collector for approval.
	Initially the citizen have to signup to post the project by submitting his crutial details like the aadhar/PAN no so that there will be no fake posts or fake people.
	Then the citizen can post the problem/project/idea by giving some details like 
		1. Title
		2. Description
       		3. Which branch of students can suitable to solve his idea
		4. Contact number of whom to consult for seeking more details
		5. Any type of file which helps the idea more understandable to students
		6. A level of urgency.
	After submission, all of his/her projects is shown in the homepage holding the status , how many teams taken the project and the nested team details respectively.


Approval Portal :

	This site is completely linked to only particular district collector and the sub collector.
	We have a Idea of making the minimal time and produce efficient quality.
	Initially , we provide login credentials to every individual district collector and those are used to get into the portal page.
	After logging in, collector will be shown the list of the submitted projects in the homepage. Collector have to go through every project and approve as per content. If it doesn’t satisfy the public rights, The collector can send back the project to modify saying a message or simply disapprove. 

	
Viewing Portal :

	This portal is unintentionally public to everyone. But in an idea for the students. There is no force of login unless someone started to work with the project (like as the SIH2k18).
	Initially, after opening the site, the student will have to provide his college/Institution and his branch. Then the projects of the college containing district and the branch suitable projects is shown in front.
	After selecting the desired project, he should signup with the verified details like aadhar number/PAN etc. to avoid fake takes. Then he should include his team and submit an abstract to initialize the take.
	In the process of solving or developing the project , the team leader can update the status of the project like “Completed the analysis” or “Started developing “ etc.
	After successful completion of the project , the team should be provided a certificate of completion which helps them to stand of the crowd to achieving jobs.
